\# Data Models

All persistent models use SwiftData, mirrored to iCloud (see \[What syncs to iCloud]\(#what-syncs-to-icloud)). Photos are JPEG \`Data\` on the models themselves (\`@Attribute(.externalStorage)\`) — no file layer, so the bytes sync with their quest.

\## UserProfile

Stores the user's onboarding results. Singleton — only one per app.

\`\`\`swift

UserProfile

├── id: UUID

├── createdAt: Date

├── updatedAt: Date

│

│  // Onboarding results (collected via Guided UI)

├── interests: \[String]                       — things they're curious about

├── comfortZoneEdges: \[String]                — what they avoid; the app's premise **as** data. Picked **in** onboarding's edge deck (preset cards + a custom one)

├── vibes: \[String]                           — how they want to experience quests; free-form (preset pills + user customs). Sent on the wire **as** \`vibe\` (singular) — the backend's field name

├── experimentationLevel: Int                 — the how-far dial (1-5): how far past the edge to push

├── budget: \[BudgetLevel]                     — .free, .cheap, .moderate, .splurge

├── transportation: \[TransportationMode]      - .walking, .publicTransport, .car, .bike, .rideshare

├── locationPreferences: \[LocationPreference] — preferred environments (e.g., Nature, Indoors)

├── additionalContext: String?                — **optional** nuance text

│

│  // Location

├── city: String                       — user's base city (e.g., "San Francisco")

├── cityLatitude: Double?              — latitude of the city center (sent to backend **for** distance/transport math)

├── cityLongitude: Double?             — longitude of the city center (sent to backend **for** distance/transport math)

│

│  // Daily generation limits (each action usable once per day; reset at local midnight; client-side only)

├── lastCuratedGenerationDate: Date?    — when the user last generated a personalized **set**

└── lastDescribedGenerationDate: Date?  — when the user last described a quest

\`\`\`

\> \*\***Onboarding completion is not on the model.**\*\* It's a plain \`@AppStorage("hasCompletedOnboarding")\` flag read by \`horizonApp\`'s \`WindowGroup\` — UserDefaults is readable synchronously at launch, so the gate never waits on a SwiftData query. (This is the one sanctioned UserDefaults use — see \`01-overview\.md\` decision #1.)

\*\***Daily limit logic:**\*\* each action recharges 24h after its stored date (\`GenerationLimit\`); \`nil\` means available. Generating a personalized set stamps \`lastCuratedGenerationDate\`; describing stamps \`lastDescribedGenerationDate\`. \*\***These are UX gating only**\*\* — the backend enforces the real 24h rolling window on the auth uid. When the server returns \`resource-exhausted\` with a \`retryAt\`, the client reconciles by back-dating its stamp to \`retryAt − 24h\`, so the two never disagree.

\## Quest

The core model. Represents a single quest regardless of its state.

\`\`\`swift

Quest

├── id: UUID

├── createdAt: Date

├── updatedAt: Date                    — bumped by every **mutating** method; mirroring doesn't expose CloudKit's own modification stamp

│

│  // Content (from Cloud Function response)

├── title: String

├── questDescription: String

├── difficulty: DifficultyRating       — .easy, .moderate, .hard, .extreme

├── estimatedActivityMinutes: Int      — estimated activity duration **in** minutes

├── categories: \[String]               — classification labels (e.g., adventure, creativity)

├── pushesComfortZoneEdges: \[String]   — which of the user's edges this quest targets, priority order (primary first); empty on generic quests. The receipt **for** what onboarding asked

│

│  // Origin (client-side; not sent by backend)

├── origin: QuestOrigin            — .personalized (from a generated **set**) or .described (from user's prompt)

├── userPrompt: String?                — the text the user typed, **for** .described quests only (**nil** otherwise)

│

│  // Location (optional — nil if quest is not location-based)

├── locationInformation: LocationInformation?

├── locationPhotoData: Data?           — the place photo, decoded once from the response's embedded base64 (@Attribute(.externalStorage)); **nil** → bundled placeholder

│

│  // State

├── status: QuestStatus            — .available, .active, .completed

├── completedAt: Date?

│

│  // Get Started guide (generated on demand, cached)

├── getStartedSteps: \[String]?         — **nil** until user requests it

│

│  // Completion data

├── journalEntry: String?              — user's reflection text

└── journalPhotoData: \[Data]           — journal photos **as** JPEG bytes (externalStorage)

\`\`\`

\### LocationInformation

Codable struct grouping all location data. Present only on location-based quests. Populated entirely from the Cloud Function response.

\`\`\`swift

LocationInformation

├── name: String                       — name of the place (e.g., "Dolores Park")

├── address: String                    — full address string

├── locationDescription: String        — editorial summary from Google Maps (named to avoid clashing with NSObject's \`description\`)

├── latitude: Double                   — **for** MapKit display

├── longitude: Double                  — **for** MapKit display

├── photoImageBase64: String?          — wire-only: embedded place-photo bytes (no URL/key); decoded into Quest.locationPhotoData on receipt, then nilled — never persisted

├── photoContentType: String?          — wire-only companion (e.g. "image/jpeg"); nilled with the base64

├── googleMapsURL: String              — URL to **open** the place **in** Google Maps

├── distanceMiles: Double?             — from backend (Haversine); present only when city coords were supplied

└── transportationOptions: \[TransportationOption] — from backend (heuristic per-mode); 0-minute placeholders when city coords absent

\`\`\`

\### TransportationOption

\`\`\`swift

TransportationOption

├── mode: TransportationMode           — .walking, .car, .publicTransport, etc.

├── estimatedTravelMinutes: Int        — estimated travel time **in** minutes

└── isRecommended: Bool                — **true** **if** the backend recommends this mode

\`\`\`

\### BudgetLevel (enum)

\`\`\`swift

.free

.cheap

.moderate

.splurge

\`\`\`

\> \*\***No QuestVibe enum.**\*\* \`vibe\` is free-form \`\[String]\` — onboarding offers preset pills (Solo, Social, Chill, Adventurous, Creative, Spontaneous, Chaotic, Night owl, Romantic, Quirky) plus an "add your own" input, and the same presets-plus-custom pattern applies to \`interests\` and \`growthAreas\`. Presets live as constants on \`OnboardingFlowScreenModel\`.

\### TransportationMode (enum)

\`\`\`swift

.walking

.publicTransport

.car

.bike

.rideshare

\`\`\`

\### LocationPreference (enum)

\`\`\`swift

.downtown

.neighborhood

.nature

.indoors

.waterfront

.anywhere

\`\`\`

\> \*\*\`**.anywhere**\`**&#x20;is mutually exclusive.**\*\* Selecting it clears every other preference, and selecting any specific preference removes it (enforced in \`OnboardingFlowScreenModel.toggleLocationPreference\`). An "all of the above including anywhere" selection biases the LLM toward the specific options and drowns out "anywhere".

\### QuestOrigin (enum)

\`\`\`swift

.personalized — came from a generated personalized **set**

.described    — built from a free-text prompt the user wrote

\`\`\`

Origin drives both UI (a subtle "your idea" badge on described quests) and the deck-clearing logic (see Daily Deck Lifecycle — generating a personalized set only clears \`.personalized\` cards).

\### QuestStatus (enum)

\`\`\`swift

.available    — sitting **in** the deck, not yet acted on

.active       — user swiped **right** + confirmed; this **is** their current quest (only one at a time)

.completed    — done, has photos/journal, moved to the logbook

\`\`\`

\> \*\***There is no skipped state.**\*\* Left-swiping is "not now," not a skip — it never removes a card or changes its status, and the deck loops. (The original design's \`.skipped\` case has been removed from the enum.)

\### DifficultyRating (enum)

\`\`\`swift

.easy      // "Within"

.moderate  // "A step out"

.hard      // "Well beyond"

.extreme   // "Far beyond"

\`\`\`

The raw values are frozen — they're the wire contract with the backend. The UI never shows them: \`displayName\` (in \`QuestFormatting\`) renders the comfort-zone phrasing above, under the stat label \*\***COMFORT ZONE**\*\*.

\## Daily Deck Lifecycle

There is no fixed "batch." The user's deck is simply every \`.available\` card they currently hold, presented as a looping swipe deck bookended by the base card. Cards are added on demand through two daily actions and persist until accepted or replaced.

\`\`\`swift

Two ways to add cards (**each** usable once per day, reset at local midnight;

both offered on the base card at the deck's start/end):

│

├── Generate personalized **set** → adds a **set** (nominally 3) quests (origin .personalized)

│       └── FIRST clears all .available cards with origin .personalized,

│           then inserts the fresh **set**  (Rule 1)

│

└── Describe your own → adds 1 quest (origin .described)

        └── FIRST clears **any** .available card with origin .described

            (the deck holds a single custom slot), then inserts

            the new one  (Rule 2)

Deck order: the described card (**if** **any**) leads, then personalized cards

newest-first — a fresh **set** **is** always what the user sees on landing.

The deck (all .available cards, looping):

│

├── User swipes **left** ("not now") → nothing changes (the card comes around next cycle)

├── User swipes **right** + confirms → quest becomes .active (1 at a time)

│

├── User wants to swap → opens the deck; the active quest stays active

│       until another **is** committed (which returns it) — backing out **is** free

│

└── User completes active quest → quest becomes .completed

        │

        └── All other cards stay **in** the deck (nothing auto-clears on completion)

\`\`\`

\*\***Key rules:**\*\*

\- Only \*\***one quest can be&#x20;**\`**.active**\`\*\* at any time. Committing to a new one (right swipe + confirm) swaps the current active quest back to \`.available\`.

\- \*\***Cards persist across days.**\*\* A card never disappears because a day passed — only accepting it or its own lane's next generation (Rules 1 & 2) changes the deck. Left swipes are \*\***never destructive**\*\*.

\- \*\***Rule 1 — a personalized generation replaces the previous personalized set.**\*\* Generating deletes all \`.available\` cards whose \`origin\` is \`.personalized\` (including a personalized quest that was swapped back out of active), then inserts the new \`.personalized\` cards. \`.completed\` quests are historical and never touched.

  - \*\***One exception: the first generation at the end of onboarding appends.**\*\* It always fires (no client-side gate — the backend decides) and never deletes, so a reinstalling user whose iCloud cards have synced back keeps them and gets the fresh set on top. Every later generation from Explore follows Rule 1 normally.

\- \*\***Rule 2 — describing replaces the previous custom quest.**\*\* Describing deletes any \`.available\` card whose \`origin\` is \`.described\` (the deck holds a single custom slot; the Describe sheet shows an inline warning naming the card being replaced), then inserts the new \`.described\` card. The \`.active\` quest and \`.completed\` quests are untouched by any generation.

\- \*\***The deck is a chooser, not a wishlist.**\*\* To keep a card, commit to it. Because only one quest can be active, the user commits to one at a time.

\- \*\***Set size is server-controlled.**\*\* The client requests a personalized set without specifying a count; the backend returns a small set (nominally 3). The app renders whatever comes back — partial success (fewer than expected) is expected and handled gracefully.

\- Each action is limited to \*\***once per 24h**\*\*, for at most \~4 new cards per day. The backend enforces this; the client gates the UI to match.

\## Onboarding

The onboarding is a paginated Guided UI flow — multi-step forms with selectable pills, sliders, and minimal typing. No chat interface.

Three steps: \*\***01 The Edge**\*\* (the comfort-zone swipe deck + the how-far dial), \*\***02 The Draw**\*\* (interests + vibes), \*\***03 The Ground**\*\* (city, budget, transportation, environments, optional notes).

\- \*\***The edge deck is the premise.**\*\* Ten preset edges, one per card, swipe right for "that's me" — chosen ones collect as pills below so the answer visibly assembles. A closing card takes a custom edge, and "Done picking" (once ≥1 is chosen) jumps straight to it, so nobody has to swipe all ten and the deck still ends the same way for everyone. Advancing the step requires at least one edge.

\- Draft state lives in \`OnboardingFlowScreenModel\` for the session only — quitting mid-onboarding restarts the flow (persistence was deliberately deferred; the flow takes \~2 minutes).

\- \*\***City is picked from MapKit locality suggestions**\*\* (\`CitySearch\` / \`CityPickerMap\`), never free-typed: \`city\` stores the disambiguated name ("St. Paul, MN") and \`cityLatitude\`/\`cityLongitude\` the exact coordinates captured at selection — no geocode-at-finish guessing (ambiguous names like "St. Paul" used to resolve to the wrong place).

\- Once the user completes all steps, the final \`UserProfile\` is fully populated and saved in SwiftData.

\- Sign in with Apple happens before the questionnaire; the first generation needs an authenticated uid.

\- The app then calls \`generateCuratedQuests\` with the full structured profile and shows the "How Horizon Works" walkthrough while it generates (the first run is always a cache miss, \~10–20s — see \`concept.md\`). The client sends no \`count\` — the set size is server-controlled — and renders whatever comes back (partial success is fine).

\- The walkthrough never waits on the generation — its last swipe lands straight in the app (no closing pane). If the user reaches Explore before the set arrives, the base card shows the "curating" state.

\## Relationships

\`\`\`swift

UserProfile (singleton — only one per app)

    │

    └── has many → Quest (all quests ever generated)

                      │

                      └── carries its journal photos inline (journalPhotoData)

\`\`\`

There's effectively one UserProfile. All Quests belong to that profile. The relationship is implicit (no explicit SwiftData relationship needed since there's only one user).

\## What syncs to iCloud

SwiftData's CloudKit mirroring (\`cloudKitDatabase: .automatic\` in \`horizonApp\`) syncs the \*\***entire store**\*\* — the profile and all quests (every status, photos included) — to the user's private iCloud database in the background. There is no sync code and no restore moment: after a reinstall, data reappears whenever the sync daemon delivers it. Two consequences the app handles:

\- \*\***Profile singleton**\*\*: re-onboarding creates a fresh profile and the old one can sync in later — \`horizonApp\` dedupes on every foreground, keeping the newest \`updatedAt\`.

\- \*\***Mirroring's model rules**\*\*: every stored property has an inline default or is optional (both models are annotated accordingly); no unique constraints.

\## Notes

\- \*\***No separate JournalEntry model**\*\* — journal text lives directly on the Quest. Since it's one entry per quest, a separate model adds complexity without benefit.

\- \*\***One active quest at a time**\*\* — the user commits to one quest from the deck (right swipe + confirm). They can swap their active quest for a different one from the deck, but only one can be \`.active\` at any given time.

\- \*\***No fixed batch**\*\* — quests are added on demand: a personalized set (nominally 3) via \`generateCuratedQuests\`, or 1 at a time via \`generateUserDescribedQuest\`, each once per day. This naturally limits backend costs.

\- \*\***No delete, no skip**\*\* — users can't remove quests from the deck directly. Cards leave only by being accepted or replaced by their lane's next generation (Rule 1 for personalized, Rule 2 for the single described slot), or cleared via re-onboarding.

\- \*\***Photos are stored as&#x20;**\`**Data**\`**&#x20;on the models**\*\* — \`journalPhotoData\` / \`locationPhotoData\`, both externalStorage. No files, no paths; the bytes sync to iCloud with the model.
