/**
 * Comma-separated uids exempt from the per-user 24h generation limit —
 * developer accounts that need to generate freely while testing.
 *
 * Stored in Secret Manager rather than a file, so the value survives every
 * deploy regardless of who triggers it (a `.env` is gitignored and therefore
 * invisible to CI, which would silently reset the list on each pipeline run).
 * See docs/developer/secrets-and-config.md for how to set it.
 *
 * Unset resolves to "" — nobody exempt — so an environment that configures
 * nothing gates every user normally.
 *
 * Safe to leave configured: `request.auth.uid` comes from a signed Firebase
 * Auth token, so only the account owner can present it, and total spend stays
 * bounded by the Maps daily quotas and the per-provider LLM rate windows.
