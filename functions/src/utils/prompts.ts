THE POINT (matters most):
Horizon sends people to do the things they avoid. Their edges below are what they're reluctant or afraid to do. Every query must set up a place where acting on an edge is natural. Interests decide WHERE and WHAT KIND of place; the EDGE decides what makes it a stretch.
Example: edge "Talking to strangers" + interest "coffee" -> "specialty coffee bar with counter seating in ${profile.city}" (a place where striking up a conversation is natural) — NOT just "highly-rated coffee shop".

COMFORT-ZONE EDGES (target these): ${edges}
Interests (flavor / where): ${interests} | Vibe (tone): ${vibe} | Location prefs: ${locationPreferences}
City: ${profile.city}

HOW TO CHOOSE:
- SPREAD across edges. If the user has several, cover DIFFERENT ones across the ${count} queries — not ${count} variations on a single edge.
- Pick real, well-regarded places (a specific cafe, studio, class, market, venue, trailhead) — quality over novelty. A great spot where the edge is doable beats an obscure one.
- Write FINDABLE queries: real businesses/POIs with reviews. Avoid abstractions Maps can't resolve ("urban exploration sites", "ghost tour starting points").
- Include the city/region name in every query so Maps searches the correct area.

HOW FAR TO PUSH — experimentation level ${profile.experimentationLevel}/5 sets how far past the edge to go, and drives 'intendedDifficulty' (the size of the social/personal stretch, NOT geographic distance):
1 -> easy (right at the edge of comfortable)
2 -> easy/moderate (a step out)
3 -> moderate (a real stretch)
4 -> hard (well beyond)
5 -> hard/extreme (far beyond — bolder settings and asks)
Assign each concept an 'intendedDifficulty' from this scale.

RULES:
1. Generate exactly ${mapsResults.length} quests.

"" : " Spread the set across DIFFERENT edges rather than repeating one."}
3. 'difficulty' = how far past the edge the quest pushes, set from the experimentation level: 1 -> easy, 2 -> easy/moderate, 3 -> moderate, 4 -> hard, 5 -> hard/extreme.
4. 'pushesComfortZoneEdges': the edge(s) this quest actually makes the user face — copied VERBATIM from the comfort-zone edges above (exact wording and casing), ordered most-central first, 1 to 3 entries max. Do NOT rephrase, pluralize, or invent an edge the user didn't list. Include only edges the quest genuinely pushes.
5. 'estimatedActivityMinutes' must reflect the activity time in minutes. Do NOT include travel time.
6. For each quest, provide the 'assignedLocationId' of the location you are writing the quest for.
7. Provide the 'recommendedTransportationMode' (must be one of the modes available in that location's transportationOptions).
8. Write a 'locationDescription': a vivid but VERY short summary of the place itself (what it is and why it's worth visiting), based on its name and address. Maximum 1-2 sentences. Describe the PLACE, not the quest.`;

4. Integrate the user's Interests, Vibe, and — where it fits naturally — a comfort-zone edge, to make these highly personalized.
